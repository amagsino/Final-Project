# Final Project on Causes of Death in the United States

## Background:
Scientists are constantly trying to find out what factors lead to death whether it be behavioral, environmental, or financial. This is inspired by the current trends on health awareness, the improvement of healthy habits, and the increase in life expectancy. We wanted to analyze factors that may show correlation to death rates across the US according to data from the CDC, Americaâ€™s Health Rankings Organization, and the Bureau of Economic Analysis on a 5-year time scale from 2011-2016.

## Goal:
Analyze the relationship between tobacco use, obesity rates, and per capita income on the number of deaths on a state and national level

## Hypothesis:
Obesity, tobacco, and income are all positively correlated factors to number of deaths

## Variables for Exploration:
Tobacco Use %, Obesity %, Per Capita Income, Number of Deaths

## Tools Used:
Pandas, Matplotlib, Tableau, Scikit-Learn, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

## Trends Found: 
The R2 of .56 indicates that the model explains about 56% of the variability of the data around the mean. The differences between states are significant and can cause outliers and contribute to the skewed results of the analysis. The mean scored error, which shows the averaged squared difference between the predicted and actual values was .39, close to the desired 0 range. Overall, the probabilities of a positive correlation between number of deaths and tobacco use, obesity rates, and per capita income combined are relatively low. These factors alone are not enough to cause a strong correlation. Increasing the amount of data with more variables would have improved the results of the predicted model.
