# Final Project on Causes of Death in the United States

## Background:
Scientists are constantly trying to find out what factors lead to death whether it be behavioral, environmental, or financial. This is inspired by the current trends on health awareness, the improvement of healthy habits, and the increase in life expectancy. We wanted to analyze factors that may show correlation to death rates across the US according to data from the CDC, America’s Health Rankings Organization, and the Bureau of Economic Analysis on a 5-year time scale from 2011-2016.

## Goal:
Analyze the relationship between tobacco use, obesity rates, and per capita income on the number of deaths on a state and national level

## Hypothesis:
Obesity, tobacco, and income are all positively correlated factors to number of deaths

## Variables for Exploration:
Tobacco Use %, Obesity %, Per Capita Income, Number of Deaths

## Tools Used:
Pandas, Matplotlib, Tableau, Scikit-Learn, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

## Trends Found: 
None of the variables explored contribute alone to the number of deaths

Most of the states per capita income for all years shows that although, income increases slightly. deaths are only slightly increasing 

Relative to each state, obesity rates don’t change significantly per year

Number of deaths nationally increase every year

With More time: We considered adding dropdowns that enable the user to select and filter out the graphs as well as another js library.
